# Advanced Database Systems

There are my homeworks done in few NoSQL languages during attending the course "Advanced Database Systems" at Faculty of Information Teechnology at Czech Technical University in Prague during my stay on Erasmus at this university in winter semester 2018/19.

I used 4 languages for queries: XQuery, Sparql, MongoDB and Neo4j.
